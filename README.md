# swabhiman-main

Overview:
Our project- Swabhiman-sashakt roop , offers an app based solution to the deprived sections of women- the widows and the separated/divorced women. It provides them assistance in 4 crucial areas- the banking system, the Legal rights, Skill Identification and the access to affordable health schemes. Through  app we provide them the necessary information for the  schemes and govt provisions that are curated for them. We believe our app can rebuild and strengthen their lives and help them live with respect and dignity. It'll make them financially independent and secure them their much needed recognized social identity.
